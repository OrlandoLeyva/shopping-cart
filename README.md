# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` 

As the node modules are ignored in .gitignore

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Challenges`

(1.) The UI for ediiting items in cart was diffcult to manage on mobile screen so I was left to 2 option to either remove that functionality in mobile or create a new page to edit the items. I went for 2nd option and have created a checkout page to edit items.

(2.) It was mentioned that the items should be stored in component state. But I have stored them in redux-store as I was using checkout page for editing the items.

### `Improvements`

(1.) Items in the cart are not saved anywhere the are stored in the state. Refreshing the page will remove all the items present in cart. We have to store them in local storage so after page refresh we still have items in our cart.

(2.) Items cannot be edited in the cart we have to navigate to checkout page to increase decrease or remove items. Doing that is simple we just need to use addItem, removeItem and clearItem methods that are present in the actions.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
